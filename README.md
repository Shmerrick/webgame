# Game Simulator

**Version:** 16.0

This project contains a web-based game simulator and a command-line tool to view the material database.

## Running the Webpage

The webpage needs to be served by a local web server for the database to load correctly. Opening the `index.html` file directly in your browser from the file system will not work.

1.  **Navigate to the `public` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd public
    ```

2.  **Start a simple web server:**
    If you have Python 3, you can use its built-in web server.
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
    If you have Python 2, use this command instead:
    ```bash
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    ```
    Alternatively, if you have Node.js and npm installed, you can use the `serve` package.
    ```bash
    npx serve
    ```

3.  **Open the webpage in your browser:**
    Open your web browser and go to the following address:
    [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

    You should now see the website, and the material database and simulator should be fully functional.

## Database

The material data is stored in `public/db.json`. This file is used by both the webpage and the C++ database viewer.

### Regenerating the Database

The `public/db.json` file is generated by the `transform_data.py` script. If you make changes to the source data within the script, you can regenerate the database by running:

```bash
python3 transform_data.py
```

This will overwrite the existing `public/db.json` with the new data.

## C++ Database Viewer

This is a command-line tool to display the contents of `public/db.json` in a formatted table.

### Compiling the Database Viewer

The C++ project uses CMake, which can generate build files for various environments.

#### Compiling on Linux/macOS

Follow these steps from the root directory of the project:

1.  **Navigate to the `cpp` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd cpp
    ```

2.  **Run CMake to generate the build files:**
    ```bash
    cmake .
    ```

3.  **Run make to compile the program:**
    ```bash
    make
    ```

    This will create an executable file named `database_viewer` in the `cpp` directory.

#### Compiling on Windows with Visual Studio

1.  **Install Prerequisites:**
    - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (make sure to include the "Desktop development with C++" workload).
    - [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).

2.  **Generate Visual Studio Solution:**
    Open a command prompt, navigate to the `cpp` directory, and run CMake to generate a Visual Studio solution. You may need to specify your Visual Studio version.

    ```bash
    cd cpp
    # For Visual Studio 2022
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" .
    # For Visual Studio 2019
    # cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" .
    ```
    This will create a `DatabaseViewer.sln` file in the `cpp` directory.

3.  **Build the project:**
    You can build the project in two ways:

    *   **Option A: Using Visual Studio IDE**
        1.  Open the `DatabaseViewer.sln` file in Visual Studio.
        2.  In the top menu, select `Build > Build Solution`.
        3.  The executable `database_viewer.exe` will be located in the `cpp/Debug` or `cpp/Release` directory.

    *   **Option B: Using the Command Line**
        Run the following command from the `cpp` directory:
        ```bash
        cmake --build .
        ```
        The executable `database_viewer.exe` will be located in the `cpp/Debug` or `cpp/Release` directory.

### Running the Database Viewer

After compiling, you can run the viewer from within the `cpp` directory:

```bash
./database_viewer
```

This will read `../public/db.json` and print its contents to your console.
